      Once in a while, Doris Burke lets slip on the air about her Knicks fandom. Born on Long Island and raised on the Jersey Shore in Manasquan, Burke hears about it.

“We’re not supposed to root, and I don’t root when I’m calling the games,’’ Burke told The Post. “I am a New Yorker. My fandom as a young NBA person was the Knicks. I’ve mentioned it on occasion and taken ribbing on Twitter.”

That is why when the ESPN basketball broadcasting star made her first appearance at the Las Vegas summer league in July, she finally felt good about her cursed childhood team.

“I’m excited about the Knicks,’’ said Burke, in New York on Thursday for a screening of the documentary series “Basketball: A Love Story.” “I know there’s a long way to go. But Kristaps [Porzingis] is a longtime All-Star when he’s healthy. I was excited to see Kevin Knox in summer league.”

Knox makes his Knicks debut in Monday’s preseason opener in Washington.

“I know success in summer league doesn’t always translate initially to success in the regular season,’’ Burke said. “But what we saw from Kevin in summer league was to me a natural scorer, someone who can score at all three levels consistently — get to the cup, play in between, shoot with range. Athletically he has what it takes to succeed. I don’t want to go overboard on what he achieved in summer league, but it certainly was enough to be excited about his potential.”

Burke was in San Diego on Saturday, scheduled to work LeBron James’ preseason debut with the Lakers the next day. On Tuesday, the broadcasting pioneer will spearhead the “espnW: Women + Sports Summit” in Newport Beach, Calif.

Burke awaits her assignment for Christmas Day.

“I don’t know where I’ll be,’’ Burke said. “Nothing would make me happier than that noon game in New York City.”

                        Tim Hardaway Jr. and David Fizdale have come full circle

      
             
     

    

   
   
   
  
     
    Tim Hardaway Jr. said he believes coach David Fizdale will...       

     
              

 



Perhaps it’s a longshot Porzingis will make his return from ACL surgery for the Dec. 25 game against the Bucks, but Burke hopes it’s at some point this season — as long as the 7-foot-3 Latvian is perfectly healthy. She can’t understand the rationale for sitting him out the season — even when ready — like the 76ers’ Ben Simmons did in 2016-17.

“The Knicks have every reason to be conservative with Kristaps,’’ Burke said. “This is an organization whose leadership is committed to the long-term health and viability of the organization. Which means you’ll do absolutely nothing to jeopardize one of the foundational pieces. That said, at some point, if you are completely confident you are in no way putting this young man at further risk, why not give him the opportunity to get some repetitions with Knox on the floor?

“I understand the argument to be super-conservative. Maybe if it’s March and you’re just to the point it’s not in the best interests. It all comes down to the timing when he’s passing those tests.’’

The lanky Porzingis is not a finished product, but isn’t far away from overcoming one weakness: occasionally being knocked off balance by physical play.

“The most exciting part is there’s another few levels he can reach,’’ Burke said. “I’m not saying he’s ever going to necessarily have the physique that’s Lebron-like. However, players start to understand how to absorb contact and not get thrown off their path to the cup or their ability to get separation in a 1-on-1 situation and create a dribble pull-up jump shot. All those things continue to evolve. For Kristaps, that’s part of this, but the overall skill set — athleticism, ability to affect the game on both ends — has got to be incredibly exciting for Knicks fans.’’

    Two medical experts believe an extremely tall player such as...       

     
              

 



When Burke did sideline reporting during the days of the Miami Dream Team, she developed a working relationship and became close to then-Heat assistant coach David Fizdale.

“I got to know him during those years,’’ Burke said of the new Knicks head coach. “I got a chance to see him interact with players and see the respect all those guys had for him, see his interpersonal skills and basketball ability. I thought David was a great choice — incredibly energetic, passionate, knowledgeable.”

The big question is how Fizdale might handle the expected losing season.

“When you are young, it comes with bad stretches, and you have to be able to weather that,’’ Burke said. “It doesn’t make the losing easy. That takes a physical and mental toll on everybody involved in it. David has the kind of stamina and personality to absorb it and get the culture the way he wants it.’’

In passing on the Jimmy Butler Sweepstakes, Burke thought the Knicks lived up to their word of “patience’’ and “valuing draft picks.’’ She said of Butler, “I have great respect for his work habits and he values winning, but you had two straight teams from a personnel standpoint didn’t work for him. You have to evaluate that.’’

The Knicks won’t be on national TV much, but Burke will still be watching.

“It gives you hope as a fan because there’s a plan,’’ Burke said.
